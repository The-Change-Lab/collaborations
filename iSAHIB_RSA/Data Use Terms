The Intraindividual Study of Affect, Health and
Interpersonal Behavior(https://thechangelab.stanford.edu/isahib/)
(iSAHIB) is an intensive longitudinal study that collected rich
repeated measures of its namesake variables at multiple time-scales.
Participants, 150 adults (age 18-89 years, 51% women) from the
Pennsylvania State University and surrounding community, completed three
3-week "measurements bursts" during which they reported on their social
interactions, thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.
