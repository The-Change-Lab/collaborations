# The Change Lab Collaborations

This repository contains materials from The Change Lab's research collaborations. 
These are shared with intent to facilitate learning and teaching about analysis of intensive longitudinal data. 
Use lisences are in each folder. 

If you have any questions about these project or this repository, please email [The Change Lab](https://thechangelab.stanford.edu) at [thechangelab@stanford.edu](mailto:thechangelab@stanford.edu).

## [AMIB](https://github.com/The-Change-Lab/collaborations/tree/main/AMIB)
The AMIB Data, collected as part of a multiple time-scale study, are useful for illustrating a variety of methods for modeling of i
ntensive longitudinal data. The data include person-level *dispositions*, *daily* diary assessments, and 
ecological momentary assessments that were obtained after everyday social *interactions* (event-contingent sampling).       

The data are shared with intent to facilitate learning about analysis of *intensive longitudinal data* (from experience sampling, daily diary, or 
EMA designs). **The data are posted only for teaching purposes and should not be used for research.**  

Use requires citation and acknowledgement of both this website and the following paper:

Please contact us with questions about the data and their use. We always appreciate knowing how the data are being used to 
facilitate learning and teaching. If you find something interesting, please let us know. 
We are happy to engage collaboration around a similar data set that is larger (in terms of both persons and occasions). 

Cheers,

## [The Cortisol Data](https://github.com/The-Change-Lab/collaborations/tree/main/TheCortisolData)
The Cortisol Data is an N = 34, T = 9 time points data set we have used to illustrate a variety of growth modeling and mixture modeling methods. 
The data are shared with intent that others may find them useful for learning about growth modeling or developing new methods for analysis of change.

New publications based on these data require citation and acknowledgement of the full set of papers that have used the data, and …
