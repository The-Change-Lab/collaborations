# The Change Lab Collaborations

This repository contains materials from The Change Lab's research collaborations. 
These are shared with intent to facilitate learning and teaching about analysis of intensive longitudinal data. 
Use lisences are in each folder. 

If you have any questions about these project or this repository, please email [The Change Lab](https://thechangelab.stanford.edu) at [thechangelab@stanford.edu](mailto:thechangelab@stanford.edu).

## [AMIB](https://github.com/The-Change-Lab/collaborations/tree/main/AMIB)
The AMIB Data, collected as part of a multiple time-scale study, are useful for illustrating a variety of methods for modeling of i
ntensive longitudinal data. The data include person-level *dispositions*, *daily* diary assessments, and 
ecological momentary assessments that were obtained after everyday social *interactions* (event-contingent sampling).       

The data are shared with intent to facilitate learning about analysis of *intensive longitudinal data* (from experience sampling, daily diary, or 
EMA designs). **The data are posted only for teaching purposes and should not be used for research.**

Please contact us with questions about the data and their use. We always appreciate knowing how the data are being used to 
facilitate learning and teaching. If you find something interesting, please let us know. 
We are happy to engage collaboration around a similar data set that is larger (in terms of both persons and occasions). 

Cheers,

## [Growth Modeling](https://github.com/The-Change-Lab/collaborations/tree/main/GrowthModeling)
Growth models are among the core methods for analyzing how and when people change. Discussing both structural equation and multilevel modeling approaches, Grimm, Ram & Estabrook (2016) leads readers step by step through applying each model to longitudinal data to answer particular research questions. It demonstrates cutting-edge ways to describe linear and nonlinear change patterns, examine within-person and between-person differences in change, study change in latent variables, identify leading and lagging indicators of change, evaluate co-occurring patterns of change across multiple variables, and more. User-friendly features include real data examples, code (for Mplus or NLMIXED in SAS, and OpenMx or nlme in R), discussion of the output, and interpretation of each model's results.

## [The Cortisol Data](https://github.com/The-Change-Lab/collaborations/tree/main/TheCortisolData)
The Cortisol Data is an N = 34, T = 9 time points data set we have used to illustrate a variety of growth modeling and mixture modeling methods. 
The data are shared with intent that others may find them useful for learning about growth modeling or developing new methods for analysis of change.
