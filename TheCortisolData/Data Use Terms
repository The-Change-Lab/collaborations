The Cortisol Data is an N = 34, T = 9 time points data set we have used to illustrate a variety of growth modeling and mixture modeling methods. The data are shared with intent that others may find them useful for learning about growth modeling or developing new methods for analysis of change.

New publications based on these data require citation and acknowledgement of the full set of papers that have used the data, and â€¦
